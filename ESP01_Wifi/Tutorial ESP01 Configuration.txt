Direct Coding:

1) Connection:
ESP01->Arduino Nano
EN+3V3->3.3V
GPIO1(only for code upload)+GND->GND
Rx(voltage devider)->RX
Tx->Tx

2) Arduino IDE:
Open Code.
Board: ESP8266 General Module.
Port: number.

3) Upload:
Click upload then wait for finish.
Unplug the USB.
Unplug the the GPIO1 pin.
Plug the USB and open monitor port.
The output must appear. If not Reset the arduino and the esp01 (by connecting the GND to RST for 3 seconds).


For AT Commands:

1) Reset the components.

2) Connection:
ESP01->Arduino Nano
EN+3V3->3.3V
GND->GND
Rx(voltage devider)->RX
Tx->Tx

3) Arduino IDE:
New File(Blank).
Board: Arduino Nano.
Processor: ATmega328P (OLD BOOTLOADER).

4)Upload: 
Unplug the RX and TX pins from one side.
Upload the blank code to the Nano.
When Done uploading, Plug the RX and Tx pins
Plug a wire between RST and GND pins on the arduino nano side.
When all set up open the Serial Monitor.
Set the speed to 115200.
Set Communication to "Both NL And CR"
Add the AT commands using the blank textbox at the top of the monitor.
